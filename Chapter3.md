Walking to prepare your body for running
For those who are not yet comfortable with running, incorporating a walking plan into your training can be beneficial. Walking helps prepare the body for the impact of running by strengthening muscles and improving cardiovascular endurance.

It also serves as a low-impact form of exercise, making it suitable for individuals with joint issues.

A walking plan usually consists of four days of walking per week, with each session lasting around 30 minutes. As you progress through the weeks, the duration and intensity of walks gradually increase to prepare your body for running.
