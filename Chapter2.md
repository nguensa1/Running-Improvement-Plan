Get motivated
If you are new to running, it is important to start slow and gradually increase your mileage. A good rule of thumb is to not increase your weekly mileage by more than 10% each week. This allows your body time to adapt and helps prevent injuries.

At Coach the Run, our Beginnerâ€™s Training Plan consists of three days of running per week, with each session lasting around 20-30 minutes. The first week runs may consist of a combination of running and walking, gradually increasing the amount of time spent running and decreasing the amount of time spent walking as the weeks progress.
